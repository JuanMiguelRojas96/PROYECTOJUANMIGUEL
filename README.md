# PROYECTOJUANMIGUEL
# Project Python 1st Semester

This README provides an overview of a basic Python code developed using a monolithic architecture, showcasing the fundamentals of the Imperative Programming Paradigm.

## Description
The project consists of a simple terminal-based program for a clothing company. It allows users to create an account, log in, update inventory, and process sales. At the end of a transaction, the program generates an invoice considering the quantities and prices of each item.

## Installation
To run the code, please ensure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x: You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org)

Once you have Python installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JuanMiguelRojas96/PROYECTOJUANMIGUEL.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd PROYECTOJUANMIGUEL

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python main.py

## Usage
Upon running the program, you will be presented with a terminal interface that guides you through various options such as creating a user, logging in, updating inventory, and processing sales. Simply follow the prompts and provide the necessary information as requested.

## Future Improvements
This basic code serves as an introduction to Imperative Programming in Python. As a starting point, it can be further expanded and enhanced with additional features, such as:

-User authentication and password encryption
-Improved error handling and input validation
-Database integration for persistent data storage
-Graphical User Interface (GUI) implementation
Feel free to explore and build upon this project according to your needs and learning objectives.
